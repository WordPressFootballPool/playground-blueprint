<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The Football Pool plugin preview is still empty when you first start it (except for some fake accounts that have been added). So, the first thing that you should do, is go to the admin area and select <a href="/wp-admin/admin.php?page=footballpool-games">Football Pool → Matches</a>. Then click on the "<strong>Import matches</strong>" button. Select one of the CSV files and click "<strong>Import CSV</strong>". This will load some matches into the plugin.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Please note that I already preloaded the images for the teams and stadiums in this demo. When you install the plugin on your own webserver, you'll need to take care of the assets yourself. Either download them (if they are bundled with a CSV), or create your own images.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Depending on when you started this preview, matches that you imported in the previous step happened in the past (e.g. you load the UEFA EURO 2024 matches when the tournament has already finished), or the matches are (partly) in the future. To see how the plugin works, it is best that you have some matches in the future (so-called "open" matches). So, if all matches are closed, just change the year of a couple of matches to the current year plus 1 and save your changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":845,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/step-2-change-dates.png" alt="Change the dates to the future, e.g. by increasing the year" class="wp-image-845"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 3</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now go to the front end of the website and select the prediction sheet from the menu. This will open up a form where you can predict the outcome of all open matches. Just enter some results for a few matches and click the "<strong>save</strong>" button.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":847,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/step-3-prediction-sheet-1024x642.png" alt="Fill in some predictions in the form" class="wp-image-847"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 4</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now change the date for the matches for which you entered some predictions to the past (e.g. current year minus 1), enter an end result for those matches and save. This will automatically start a calculation. Note: only matches in the past will be taken into account for a calculation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":848,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/step-4-set-end-results.png" alt="Set the dates back to the past, e.g. by lowering the year, and set some end result scores for matches" class="wp-image-848"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":849,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/step-4-calculation.png" alt="Let the plugin finish the calculation of scores" class="wp-image-849"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 5</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go back to the front end and look at the ranking page and/or the match results. Please note that since you were the only one that entered some predictions, all other test users will always have 0 points. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a real game, or when you log in as some other users in the demo and enter their predictions before doing a calculation, you will also see their points change. At least, if you correctly guessed some matches ;-)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've also enabled the "User Switching" plugin in this demo to be able to easily switch to another account from the WordPress → Users admin screen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":850,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/step-5-ranking.png" alt="Ranking page on the front end" class="wp-image-850"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">More to discover</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now that you've learned the basic concepts of the plugin, you can play around with other settings, enter some bonus questions or change some of the details. Remember that you can always start fresh by starting the preview again (choose "Reset site" in the menu on the top right).</p>
